# Mortality Data and Probabilistic Rates for New Zealand

A modified version of `link{nzl_mort}` where `mx` columns is an
[rvec](https://bayesiandemography.github.io/rvec/reference/rvec.html),
rather than an ordinary R vector. The rvec holds the random draws from
the posterior distribution obtained from by a Bayesian statistical
model.

## Usage

``` r
nzl_mort_rvec
```

## Format

An object of class `tbl_df` (inherits from `tbl`, `data.frame`) with 84
rows and 4 columns.
