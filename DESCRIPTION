Version: 0.1.0
Author: John Bryant
Maintainer: John Bryant <john@bayesiandemography.com>
Description: Miscellaneous functions for demographic 
    analysis. Currently only includes a function for
    calculating life expectancy. Functions for
    dealing with age groups will be added next.
    The functions are low level in the sense that they
    use simple data structure and are general-purpose.
    They are also fast.
